# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Release to npm

# -- steps for larva release, for reference
# this action would be triggered by: a button in the Actions tab
# start at the master branch
# checkout a release branch from master, 
  # increment the name (assume minor releases most of the time) by reading lerna json file
  # run git checkout
# assume changelog has been updated
# run npx lerna publish
  # asks if minor/major release, user has to manually type. probably https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/version#options
  # try running npx lerna publish minor --yes
# create a PR to merge release branch to master
  # at least one human approval required (nice to have: auto ping #larva channel asking for PR approval)
  # pipelines have to pass
  # manual merge required (nice to have: have a machine user w/ token in the allowlist that can bypass)
# tag latest release on repo

# Controls when the workflow will run
# Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
