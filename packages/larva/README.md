# Larva!

If you want _all of Larva_, this is your repo. This is where you should start for new projects and for refactoring old projects onto the system.

## Usage

From the assets directory of a project, run the following command:

`npx @penskemediacorp/larva init`

This will take a few moments since it is downloading all pieces of Larva, then it will start a local server with next step instructions...maybe?

## Configuration

This command should create a configuration file called `larva.config.js`.
