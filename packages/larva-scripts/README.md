# Larva Scripts

Inspired by [@wordpress/scripts](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/scripts), this package provides a collection of scripts for PMC development with Larva.

For asset building commands, JS and SCSS can be run at the same time, or separately, in order to minimize the build time for instances where either JS or SCSS, not both, need to be built.

## Overview of Functionality

This package is provides a single executable node file that runs CLI commands from various packages, and provides a default configuration for each. The configurations are stored in separate package so as to be available to other projects that have their own builds steps.

## Usage

To use these scripts, add the following to package.json in a project that uses the [Larva assets directory structure](https://github.com/penske-media-corp/pmc-larva/tree/master/packages/larva#usage):

```
{
	"scripts": {
		"prod": "larva prod",
		"prod:scss": "larva prod:scss",
		"prod:js": "larva prod:js",
		"dev": "larva dev",
		"dev:scss": "larva dev:scss",
		"dev:js": "larva dev:js",
		"larva": "larva serve",
		"parser": "larva parser",
		"write-json": "larva write-json",
		"backstop": "larva backstop",
		"svg-sprite: "larva svg-sprite",
		"lint": "larva lint",
		"lint:scss": "larva lint:scss",
		"lint:js": "larva lint:js",
		"lint-fix": "larva lint-fix",
		"lint-fix:scss": "larva lint-fix:scss",
		"lint-fix:js": "larva lint-fix:js",
	}
}
```
