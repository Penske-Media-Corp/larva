# SVG Icon System

Icons should be added to this directory sparingly. All files in this directory are compiled into an SVG icon sprite that is used in conjunction with `c-icon`. This file is loaded asynchronously, and should be kept as small as possible and should only contain icons used globally e.g. the search icon, social icons, and a chevron.
