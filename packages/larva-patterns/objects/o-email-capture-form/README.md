# o-email-capture-form

o-email-capture-form is an object intended to collect emails via the ExactTarget API. It contains several hidden inputs for this purpose. Although it could be used to collect emails via other services, developers should consider creating project-level patterns for such a use case. Also note that o-email-capture-form should not be used to provide an email input in a longer form – it should be used only when a form required a single input for an email 

## Available configuraitons:

* `o-email-capture-form.minimal` – This configuration shows the input as a single line, and the submit button as a small arrow to the right of the input.
