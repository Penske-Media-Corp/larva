Over two days in January 1972, the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin — she was 29 at the time — sweeps into the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts in front of a congregation and testifies to God in song. The blessed thing took nearly half a century to come out because director Sydney Pollack failed to sync the image with the sound. Then digital angels stepped in, and glory, glory, hallelujah! During Franklin’s euphoric vocal on the title song, the Rev. James Cleveland gets up, sits to one side and cries like a baby. No mystery. That’s what you do when you witness a miracle.",
